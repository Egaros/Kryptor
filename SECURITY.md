# Reporting a vulnerability

Please email me at `samuel at samuellucas dot com` using an informative subject line or use [GitHub's Advisories page](https://github.com/samuel-lucas6/Kryptor/security/advisories). I will respond as soon as possible.

Assuming consent, your name and a profile of your choice (e.g. GitHub) will be acknowledged in the GitHub release that patches the vulnerability and on the [website](https://www.kryptor.co.uk/#acknowledgements). However, I cannot currently afford to give cash rewards.
