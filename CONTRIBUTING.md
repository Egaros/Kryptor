# Code Contributions
Thank you for your interest in Kryptor. This document outlines the things you need to know about contributing code. Please follow these guidelines.

## Before Coding
- **Please ask** before embarking on a pull request. This prevents you from wasting your time implementing something that won't be accepted.
- If you want to implement a bug fix or feature request mentioned in an existing issue, please comment on that issue saying that you want to work on it.
- If you want to implement a feature request and there isn't an existing issue, please open a new issue to discuss the feature request.
- Familiarise yourself with my coding style. Please try to stick to a similar format.
- Familiarise yourself with the [C# Naming Conventions](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/8a67c0/C-Sharp-coding-standards-and-naming-conventions/) and [C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions). Please follow these conventions.
- Remember that good naming typically makes comments redundant. Only write comments when necessary - don't overdo it.
